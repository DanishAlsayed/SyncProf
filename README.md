# SyncProf
LLVM pass that generates time profiles  for Synchronization functions for C/C++ programs, focusing on servers.

My final year project under the supervision of Dr. Heming Cui at The University of Hong Kong. SyncProf employes techniques from Continuously Measuring Critical Section Pressure with
the Free Lunch Profiler (Florian David, GaÂ¨el Thomas, Julia Lawall, Gilles Muller) like critical section pressure (CSP).

To compile SyncProf.cpp in to SyncProf.so just run the "make" command and make sure to include and compile rtlib.cc in your programs source code. SyncProf instruments program code with functions from rtlib.cc, so rtlib.o should be included in wherever needed to generate the executables.

Feel free to contact me for any questions/suggestions/contribution.
